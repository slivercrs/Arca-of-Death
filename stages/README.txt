This is from Type Wild's Pokemon fighting game that was made with
Fighter Maker. As the game itself is unfinished, this is private for
the time being. It'll be released later, just wanting to give TW some
time before a flood of mugen releases hit personally :P

The stage is exact as I could make it, though the lamp lights are a
little different than their game counterparts: I like the effect
personally :P

Obviously high-res winmugen only.
