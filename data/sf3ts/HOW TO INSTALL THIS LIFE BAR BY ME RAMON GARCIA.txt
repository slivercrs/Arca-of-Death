1- COPY AND PASTE THE FOLDER INSIDE THE FOLDER ''DATA''
2-OPEN YOU ''system.def'' AND CHANGE THIS PART IN ''fight = fight.def'' to ''fight = sf3ts/fight.def'' see:

BEFORE WAS THIS WAY:
[Files]
spr = system.sff          ;Filename of sprite data
snd = system.snd          ;Filename of sound data
logo.storyboard =         ;Logo storyboard definition (optional)
intro.storyboard =        ;Intro storyboard definition (optional)
select = select.def       ;Character and stage selection list
fight = fight.def         ;Fight definition filename

AFTER MUST BE THIS WAY:

[Files]

intro.storyboard =        ;Intro storyboard definition (optional)
select = select.def       ;Character and stage selection list
